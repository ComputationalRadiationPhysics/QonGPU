* TASKS
*** TODO 1.Get type checking working
**** TODO For the whole project:
Since I had the glourious idea to use some templates, 
I failed horribly to get type safety working. Therefore I'll need
a way to get some Typesafety in SimDef.hpp. I improvised and since I know 
not a single person willing to us/intrested in the project it's not that important 
*** TODO 2.Rewrite to thrus::vector<cuDoubleComplex>
*** TODO in Numerov1d!!
	
* Known BUGS
** TODO 1. High resource needs will fail: 
Since psi is first saved in an array of dimension ne*nx, the attempt to allocate 
an array bigger in size than size_t will fail horribly! I will fix this in the
future, but since time is currently an important factor I simply don't have the time!
